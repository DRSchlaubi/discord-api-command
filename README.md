# discord-api-command
A simple Command API for the JDA

To use it, download the .jar file from the folder out. I'm currently working on deploying it on a maven repository so it's even easier to implement.
On how to use it:
- In the docs-folder, there's a documentation which you might want to take a look at.
- Besides, you can read the comments

All you need to do is: Set your CommandSettings and then activate them. To write your own commands, just implement ICommand. You need an extra class for each command.
